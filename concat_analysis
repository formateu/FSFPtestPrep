[] ++ ys     = ys
(x:xs) ++ ys = x : (xs ++ ys)

Complexity of ++ operator is O(N), where N = length (x:xs)

// Q: Would it be better if concat operator is left associative or right associative?

                        ("abc" ++ "de") ++ "fg" 1)
"abc" ++ "de" ++ "fg" =
                        "abc" ++ ("de" ++ "fg") 2)

A: Right associative, because of string lenghts in this case:
1) 3 + 5 = 8 recursive calls
2) 2 + 3 = 5 recursive calls
